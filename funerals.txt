We were 5 friends that made it out of Corn Country, sanity and friendship intact. It wasn't until a year after our friendship had passed the quarter century mark, that the first of us died.
James had always been the over-cautious of the bunch, so it seemed ironic that he should be the one to step out in-front of a bus speeding towards end-of-shift after another senseless Thursday night of drinking. Maybe James just didn't need another Hungover Friday under his belt.
I'm not one to say you shouldn't invite 4 early-30's best friends of the deceased to a funeral, but the thought did cross my mind as we stood cracking jokes outside the church.
Running out of ways to mock the concept of having to consider our own mortality before the first of us had even fathered children at the get-together following the ceremony, our attention turned to all the things we would do differently for our own funeral.
One pointed out, that the lack of crying strippers railing 'fat ones' off the casket lid was testament to a life not lived to it's fullest capacity.
Another countered, that if people mourned your death you had died with an unexercised positive karma-balance. HE would see to it that people would celebrate his passing.
The Gloomy One was all-in-all indifferent to what we did after his passing, but suggested that we - for our own sake - follow his casket to the incinerator and make sure The Evil doesn't escape it's fiery grave.
The last of us was convinced that a turnout of more than 5 people to his ceremony would be proof the he had ultimately failed. HIS death would be discussed behind closed doors of every major intelligence agency of the civilized world and the world would tremble! But it wouldn't mourn.
Looking back at the drunken nonsense of that night another quarter century later, it's eerie how accurate our predictions were.
