The Whore is exactly what you think: men pay her to have sex with her. But that's not what we need her for. We need her as a cutout, but of course: we can't tell her that.
We have to be careful with The Whore, because she knows about the masks. She sees them everyday on her clients, and she sees her clients take of their masks. Can she see through the masks? Will she see through me?
The Whore says she is surprised that I knocked on her door. "Good evening miss Jansen. What are your hourly rates?". That was too blunt. I won't try to recover. If it fails tonight, leave the door open for trying again tomorrow. It seems the door is not entirely closed. "I would like to contract you for a job Miss Jansen. Will you meet me at the tavern in 1 hour?". "Contract you for a job" seems to have been overly formal. I don't think she trusts me, but she relents.
"Miss Jansen: I want to pay you money to act". I had expected her to be surprised, and I think she is. I tell her my story. My story, of course, is not real.
I tell her I work corporate. I tell her I make a lot of money. I tell her I have a boss that looks like her. I tell her my boss makes me nervous. I tell her I want to practice having professional conversations. I DON'T tell her that she will be having these same conversations with The Father pretty soon. I DO pay her double her normal hourly rate. 
Communicating with The Whore was easier than I had let myself believe, and when my complete inability to reflect her feelings or pick up on verbal cues got in the way, money was there to save the day.
Luckily, money will never be in short supply.
