The Whore is exactly what you think: men pay her to have sex with her. But that's not what we need her for. We need her as a cutout, but of course: we can't tell her that.
The Whore is also the second-most powerful person in the Village. Or, at least she is to me and to the success of my journey here. 
The Whore is powerful because she knows about the masks. She sees them every day as they fall and uncover the faces of her clients. I believe she can see through the masks, and if I am not careful, she will see through me. Had not the arguments in favor of using the Whore been so strong, we would not use her.
The Whore says she is surprised that I knocked on her door. I have thought for a long time on how to introduce myself. Most importantly, I have thought about how to explain myself. "Blunted affect". Lack of expression. "I suffer from severe degree of blunted affect. I cannot express emotions". Blunted affect is associated with a range of psychological and behavioral disorders. Plot the points, let the Whore fill in the lines. But not as an opener. My opener is short. "Good evening miss Jansen. What are your hourly rates?". Too blunt. Don't try to recover. If it fails tonight, leave the door open for trying again tomorrow. It seems the door is not entirely closed. "I would like to contract you for a job Miss Jansen. Will you meet me at the tavern in 1 hour?". "Contract you for a job" seems to have been overly formal. I don't think she trusts me, but she relents.
"I will get straight to the point Miss Jansen: I want to pay you money to act". I had expected her to be surprised, and I think she is. I will throw out a little more bait.
"I have a professional problem. I have recently found employment at a large corporation, and it is very hard for me to interact with my new boss". She is not asking any questions, but she is also not stopping me. Should I weave in "Blunted affect" now? "I saw you at the square yesterday Miss Jansen, and you look very much like her. I want to pay you to have conversations with me that are common at the workplace, so that I may practice how to respond". "What kind of questions?" she asks. Good. "I have written down a questions I have had trouble with. 'What does a handsome young man like you feel about being under woman like me?'". Her facial expression changes. Did she bite?
"What is it about you boss that makes you uncomfortable?" Not to self: my boss makes me uncomfortable. "I don't know. I hope to find out". 
"May I ask you a personal question mr....?" Yes you may Miss Jansen! "My name is Alex Ekman, and you should feel free to ask me a personal question". "It's called blunted affect. I have always been like this". I think she has bought it. 
There is no new boss making sexual overtures at me, and there is no new job. The lines we are rehearsing are the Whore's lines, but she shouldn't know this. For now, we agree to have 5 sessions at the Tavern.
