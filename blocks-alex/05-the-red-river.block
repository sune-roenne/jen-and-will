Living in The Village has turned out to be a lot easier than I expected. As long as I remember to say "Good Morning" and "Good Evening", nobody expects that I am any different from them.
I won't deny that I have been very lucky. The Whore turned out to be a grand actor. The Father turned out to really like The Whore. In fact, The Father turned out to really like The Whore in a cheap rental above the tavern three times per week. The Whore liked the money, and she may even have liked The Father. The Father made the cleanup easier by keeping his meetings with The Whore a secret. The Mother's guilty conscience may have helped. 
They are all dead now. HE took care of that. "Another family tragedy" said the newspapers. The Whore is dead from unrelated circumstances. Or so the newspapers say.
Our radio-network is working really well, and HIS plan is unfolding above expectation. But HE doesn't care. 
He came across The Woman by accident, and she led him down to The Red River, and now, all HE wants to do is stare into the river. HE is becoming ever more obsessed with The Red River and it's thick red current through the land. It won't be long until he jumps into the river, and that will be the end of our journey.
But I came to The Village, and I communicated my story to you.
