"We need you to build machines for us. Radios. For this, we will pay you a lot of money"
"The market for radios is saturated. Why would people want to buy the radios I build?"
We are not really talking about radios. We are talking about open source communication and directory platforms, but re-telling it here, it seems simpler to talk about radios.
"We believe that existing radio manufacturers pose a threat to our society. We believe that radio communication has become a cornerstone to our way of life. We believe that radio communication should be treated as a critical system, and that the radio network should be open to public scrutiny. We believe that every man and woman has a right to step onto the radio information highway, and should not be limited by the capitalist interest of a few large radio manufacturers" I prophesize. 
"Then how will you make money to pay me?" asks The Father.
I have taken a chance by agreeing to meet with The Father in his home. The Father poses no threat to me. On one of his good days, he might have pushed back in haggling the price of his labor, but from the looks of things, he hasn't had a good day in a while. When I pay him a month in advance, his questions stop.
I have to make it out of the house before The Mother comes home. She poses a bigger threat to me than The Whore. She has dedicated her life to the study of masks.
"You will probably be dealing a lot with my boss. She micro-manages", I say as I head out the door. The Father doesn't care. But he will.
